# Hi!
- My name is Seungpyo Hong. 
- I am a bioinformatician and computational biologist exploring how our body works by describing biological phenomena with computational and mathematical models and data. 
- I get the PhD degree at the department of Bio and Braining Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea. During the degree course, I studied the three dimensional structure of proteins and investigated how it interact with small compounds and other proteins. 
- During the course, I learned machine learning and data analysis techniques along with protein structure modeling techniques.
- Currently I am interested in building computational models to explain biological phenomena and to modulate it to improve the health of ours.

# Current research interest
- (Microbiome) Currently I am working on how micro-organism on our body affects our health.
- (Protein-ligand interaction) 
- (Enzyme design)
