# Hi!
My name is Seungpyo Hong. I am a bioinformatician and computational biologist exploring how our body works by describing biological phenomena with computational and mathematical models and data. I get the PhD degree at the department of Bio and Braining Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea. During the degree course, I studied the three dimensional structure of proteins and investigated how it interact with small compounds and other proteins. 

# Interest
I am a bioinformatician, data scientist, chemist and biologist, interested in revealing biological knowledge by analyzing data obtained from biolocial and chemical experiments.
